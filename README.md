# Homework #1
### Collections

This is a program for working with nucleic acid.

- transcribe
- complement 
- reverse

## Commands

`transcribe` - print the transcribed sequence. **Attention:** work only with DNA
`reverse` - print reversed sequence
`complement` - print complement sequence
`reverse complement` - print reverse complement sequence
`exit` â€” exit from the program


##### Notes
I think the code for this program could be shorter and clearer. Maybe I should optimize the valid sequence check in the main function... I don't know
