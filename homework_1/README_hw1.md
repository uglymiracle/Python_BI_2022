This is a program for working with nucleic acid.

- transcribe
- complement 
- reverse

`transcribe` - print the transcribed sequence. **Attention:** work only with DNA

`reverse` - print reversed sequence

`complement` - print complement sequence

`reverse complement` - print reverse complement sequence

`exit` â€” exit from the program


##### Notes
I think the code for this program could be shorter and clearer. Maybe I should optimize the valid sequence check in the main function... I don't know
